FQuiz focuses on questions in Soccer, testing the users knowledge in this area.

It has 60 questions with 6 different categories (10 questions per category). Once the game starts, two categories are randomly generated to the screen and once a category is selected, there are four possible answers per question. You have three lives and it decrements one of those three lives when you get a question wrong and increments your score when you get one right. It saves your highest score and also posts your top highest score to twitter if desired.
